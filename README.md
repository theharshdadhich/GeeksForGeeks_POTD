## About

GeeksforGeeks (GFG) is a well-known platform that offers a wide range of coding challenges, algorithms, data structures, and other computer science topics. This repository aims to provide solutions to these challenges on a daily basis, helping programmers of all levels to enhance their problem-solving skills and coding proficiency.

## Problem Solving

Each day's problem solution is organized in the following manner:

- **Problem Statement:** A clear and concise description of the problem taken from GeeksforGeeks.
- **Explanation:** Detailed explanation of the approach taken to solve the problem.
- **Code:** Well-commented code snippets in various programming languages.
- **Time Complexity:** Analysis of the time complexity of the solution.
- **Space Complexity:** Analysis of the space complexity of the solution.
- **Input/Output Examples:** Sample input and output examples to illustrate the usage of the solution.



## Usage

You can navigate through the daily solutions using the repository's directory structure. Each problem is stored in a separate folder named after the problem's title or a relevant keyword. Inside each folder, you will find the solution files along with any necessary resources.

To run or test the code, make sure you have the required programming language's environment set up on your machine.

## Resources

In addition to the problem solutions, you can find helpful resources related to coding, algorithms, and data structures in the directory. These resources include links to relevant GFG articles, video explanations, and other online tutorials.
